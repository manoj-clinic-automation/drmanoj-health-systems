# GutLog — DOSSIER (v3.4.2)

Single source of truth. Update after every change.

## Identity
- Personal gut/health diary and quick-log surface — medication doses, symptom
  episodes, vitals, meals, labs, consults
- Runs on the personal VPS behind the OpenLiteSpeed reverse proxy, on its own
  subdomain and loopback port. Companion apps: RxGuard, FitLog.
- Repo: `drmanoj-health-systems/gutlog/`
- Single-file Flask app plus a SQLite database, both under the app directory.

> **Hostnames, ports, IPs and absolute paths are deliberately not in this file.**
> This repository is public. The concrete values live in
> `gutlog/INFRA_GutLog.local.md`, which is gitignored.

The app directory also holds **two dead database files** from earlier versions.
`app.py:19` reads the `GUTLOG_DB` environment variable, defaulting to the
current database under the app directory. Confirm which file is live before
pointing any script at "the database" — this is the GutLog half of the
CLAUDE.md §4 lesson.

## Architecture
- Single-file Flask (`app.py`, ~3,900 lines incl. embedded HTML/CSS/JS) + SQLite
- `pwa.py` — manifest, service worker, icons. Installable to the phone home screen.
- Patchers are the only way `app.py` changes: anchor-verified, compile-checked,
  `.bak` before write, idempotent, self-restoring on post-write compile failure.
  Never re-upload the whole file.

## Auth
Login password + separate owner key set at `/setup` (first run). Hashes in the
`settings` table. Session keys: `session["ok"]`, `session["ep"]` — the latter
carries `auth_epoch()`, so changing credentials invalidates live sessions.

This is the pattern FitLog and RxGuard were built from.

## Quick-log surface (the Now tab)

The reason the app exists in this shape: logging a dose at 5am must be one tap,
not a form. Everything below serves that.

- **Blood pressure** — always open, top of the tab. Three fields, one Save.
- **Today's doses** — computed from `med_schedule` for the current day, grouped
  by slot (MORNING / NOON / EVENING / NIGHT). One tap = TAKEN. Tapping a logged
  row opens an action strip (Undo / Change dose / Skip) rather than toggling,
  so a stray second tap cannot silently delete a medication record.
- **Extra dose** — chips for unscheduled medicines, one tap logs at current time.
  Each logged extra carries a real Undo button.
- **Symptom now** — multi-select symptom types, shared severity and Bristol.
  Below the severity row, **Pain by site** tiles (Left iliac pain,
  Hypogastrium pain — `PAIN_SITES` in the page script). Tapping a tile opens
  its own 1–10 score; each site saves as its own episode with its own score.
  A selected site with no score is refused, never saved blank.

Doses, extras and symptoms are collapsible; each header carries its own summary
(`3 of 8 taken`, `2 logged today`) so state is readable without expanding
anything. Blood pressure does not collapse.

## Schema

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `prnmeds` | Medicine catalogue. id, name, sort, molecule, form, pack_size, stock, active, **scheduled** |
| `med_schedule` | Effective-dated regimen lines. id, med_id, slot, dose_text, with_food, valid_from, valid_to, **epoch**, notes, created, **variants** |
| `doses` | Every dose event. id, day, dtime, medicine, reason, effect, notes, created, **status**, med_id, sched_id, dose_text |
| `episodes` | Symptom events. id, day, etime, category, etype, side, severity, duration, notes, created, **bristol** |
| `vitals` | id, day, vtime, sys, dia, pulse, weight, waist, notes, created, temp |
| `days` | Daily rollup — syms, pain, pain_site, bristol, stools, tea, coffee, sleep, walk, treadmill, meditation, notes |
| `meals` · `library` · `foodtests` | Food logging, item library, food challenge results |
| `labs` · `consults` · `doctors` · `courses` · `patches` · `files` | Labs, visits, drug courses, patch on/off times, attachments |
| `settings` | key/value — schema_version, credential hashes, auth_epoch |

### med_schedule — effective dating

**Never edit a regimen line in place.** A dose change is a new fact about a new
period, not a correction of an old one; editing in place would silently rewrite
history and make every past dose row unexplainable.

The rule: **close the open row, open a new one.**

- `valid_from` / `valid_to` bound the period. `valid_to` NULL (or empty) = open.
- `epoch` increments on each regimen change, so a set of lines that changed
  together can be identified as one event.
- Exactly **one open row per (med_id, slot)** is enforced. A duplicate open row
  is rejected; close-then-open is accepted.
- Stopping a medicine closes the row and keeps the history — it does not delete.

Live example: one twice-daily medicine has its MORNING and EVENING lines
closed at epochs 2 and 3, with a new pair opened together at epoch 4.

`/api/now` computes today's expected doses by reading whichever line is
effective for today. Test 09 and 10 in `test_phase_a.py` gate this.

## Design decisions and why

**Expected doses are computed, never pre-created.** No nightly job writes
"today's doses" rows in advance. A row in `doses` means something actually
happened. If doses were pre-created, an unlogged day would be indistinguishable
from a day the job failed to run, and every schedule change would need a
backfill of future rows.

**A skip is a real row, not an absence.** `status='SKIPPED'` is stored. "I
deliberately did not take this" and "I have not logged yet" are different
clinical facts and must not collapse into the same blank.

**The service worker caches nothing.** It exists only because a PWA needs a
fetch handler to be installable, and it actively clears any cache a previous
version left behind (`pwa.py`). A cached medication log is a hazard — showing a
stale "taken" against a dose not actually taken is worse than showing nothing.

**Scheduled medicines are hidden from the extras row** (v3.4.0). An expected
dose belongs on the dose card. Listing it in both places invites logging it in
the wrong one, which then reads as an extra dose that never happened. A "Show
all medicines" button reveals the full list for the genuine case: an unplanned
extra dose of a regular medicine. Backed by `meds` (unscheduled) and `meds_all`
from `/api/now` — currently 15 and 22 respectively.

**A titrating medicine is scheduled *with* dose variants** — one MORNING line
carrying three strengths, rather than three lines or one fixed strength. A
titrating medicine is still a scheduled medicine; the dose is picked at log
time from the variant chips rather than by editing the regimen every time. The
picker is multi-select, because a combination of two strengths is one dose, not
two. Actual strengths are in `regimen.local.json` (gitignored).

## Deployment runbook
Concrete paths and commands are in `gutlog/INFRA_GutLog.local.md` (gitignored).

1. WinSCP upload to the app directory (never terminal paste for multi-line files)
2. Patch `app.py` via its versioned patcher — `--check` first, then apply
3. Restart the service
4. Run `test_phase_a.py` on the server → must be **18/18**
5. Verify against real data, not just the fixture — `test_phase_a.py` builds its
   own database and never touches the live one
6. OLS reverse proxy → loopback port · CyberPanel SSL · DNS A record

## Environment (verified on server, 2026-09-10)
Python 3.9.25 · SQLite 3.34.1 · Flask · gunicorn, 2 sync workers · HTTPS live
via OLS reverse proxy.

## Test evidence
- `test_phase_a.py` — **18/18 PASS** (2026-09-10, post-v3.4.0). Covers
  authenticated boot, empty schedule, regimen add, slot render, one-tap TAKEN,
  re-tap correction without duplication, skip-as-data, extra dose path, mistap
  undo, effective-dated schedule change, one-open-row constraint, stop-keeps-
  history, bristol column, vitals regression, PWA assets, page render, legacy
  endpoints, migrate fast path.
- `test_migration_v330.py` — v3.3.0 migration suite.
- Post-v3.4.0 verification against a **copy of the live database**: `/api/now`
  200 with 15 extras / 22 total and no scheduled medicine leaking into extras;
  bristol round-trip confirmed (`('Cramp', 4, '6')`); page renders 87,719 bytes
  with all six v3.4.0 changes present, no traceback.

## Known gaps

Stated plainly, because a gap that is not written down is a gap that gets
rediscovered the expensive way.

1. **Bristol was collected but silently discarded, v3.3.0 → v3.4.0.** The
   `episodes.bristol` column was added in v3.3.0 and the UI has offered the 1–7
   chips ever since, but the `/api/episodes` endpoint never included the column
   in its INSERT. Every episode logged in that window has no Bristol value and
   **the data is not recoverable** — it was never written. Fixed in v3.4.0.
   Blast radius is small: `episodes` currently holds 1 row, and it has no
   Bristol.

2. **`_migrate()` runs per request, not at startup.** It is called from `db()`
   (`app.py:306`), which is per-request via `g`. A `systemctl restart` alone
   therefore does **not** migrate — the first request after the restart does.
   Never conclude a migration ran because the service came back up.

3. **`tidy_extras.py` writes UPDATEs without taking its own backup.** Unlike the
   `app.py` patchers, it has no `.bak` step. Take a `sqlite3.backup()` copy of
   the live database before running it with `--apply`. It is dry-run by
   default, which is the only guard it has.

4. **`test_phase_a.py` test 12 checks the Bristol column exists, not that a
   value round-trips.** It would have passed 18/18 against the v3.3.0–v3.4.0
   discard bug — and did, every time it ran during that window. A green suite is
   only evidence for the code it actually executes (CLAUDE.md §2).

5. **Three medicines have no `molecule` mapped** — a laxative whose two
   formulations differ, a rehydration salt mix, and a live-culture supplement.
   All three are extras, and blank deliberately rather than by oversight:
   two are not single molecules at all, and guessing the third would put the
   wrong laxative into an interaction check. Anything keyed on molecule —
   RxGuard interaction checking in particular — will not see them. Names and
   full reasoning in `regimen.local.json` under `molecules_left_blank`.

6. **The systemd unit invokes gunicorn by an absolute path inside a virtualenv**
   rather than `python3 -m gunicorn`. This violates CLAUDE.md §3 and breaks if
   the venv is rebuilt or moved. FitLog and the newer units use the portable
   form. Exact `ExecStart` line in `INFRA_GutLog.local.md`.

7. **`test_phase_a.py` never runs the page's JavaScript.** v3.4.0 deleted
   `openRowActions()` and `openVariantPicker()` while keeping the calls to
   them; the suite stayed 18/18 while the variant row and every logged-row
   tap were dead on the phone. Covered from v3.4.1 by `test_ui_now.py`
   (offline, real Chromium, 16 checks from v3.4.2, fails on any page JS error) and by a
   defined-if-called check inside `patch_gutlog_v341.py`. Run
   `test_ui_now.py` before shipping any patch that touches the Now-tab script.

## What's next
- **Phase B** — backfill and review surface
- **Phase C** — RxGuard interaction check across the live med stack (blocked in
  part by gap 5 — unmapped molecules are invisible to it)
- Stock and refill alerts, driven by `prnmeds.stock` / `pack_size`
- FitLog read-endpoint cutover — FitLog consuming GutLog data rather than
  duplicating it
- Cardiologist BP export from `vitals`

## Changelog
- **2026-09-11 v3.4.2 — pain by site.** Two tiles on the symptom card, each
  with its own expanding 1–10 score, saved as separate episodes sharing time
  and Bristol (`patch_gutlog_v342.py`, 6 anchors). The patcher now also
  refuses Jinja tokens (`{#`, `{{`, `{%`) in new text: `APP_PAGE` is a Jinja
  template and a CSS `{#id` broke page render in the first build — caught by
  `test_ui_now.py`, invisible to `py_compile`. `test_ui_now.py` now 16 checks
  incl. undo of a wrong tick; `test_phase_a.py` 18/18.
- **2026-09-11 v3.4.1 — dose picker restored.** Tapping a scheduled row with
  dose variants did nothing, and tapping any logged row did nothing. Cause:
  `patch_gutlog_v340.py` replaced the Now-tab script block and dropped
  `openRowActions()` / `openVariantPicker()` while keeping their calls; the
  async tap handler swallowed the ReferenceError. `patch_gutlog_v341.py`
  re-inserts both verbatim from v3.3.3 (2 anchors) and refuses to write unless
  every Now-tab function called is defined. Reproduced on v3.4.0 and cleared
  on v3.4.1 by `test_ui_now.py` 6/6; `test_phase_a.py` 18/18. Gap 7 added.
- **2026-09-10 v3.4.0 — DEPLOYED.** Readability and structure pass
  (`patch_gutlog_v340.py`, 7 anchors). Scheduled medicines hidden from the
  extras row (`meds` / `meds_all`); extra chips reordered by use via
  `tidy_extras.py`; tap feedback and real Undo buttons; multi-select symptoms
  written as one episode each sharing timestamp, severity and Bristol;
  collapsible sections with summaries in the header; larger text, real buttons,
  warmer ground (`#E9EDE7`) replacing the bright `#EFF5F2`-on-white pairing.
  **Also fixed the Bristol discard bug** (gap 1). `test_phase_a.py` 18/18.
  Rollback snapshots taken for both the app file and the database; exact
  filenames in `INFRA_GutLog.local.md`.
- **2026-09-10 hardening (2)** — clinical detail removed from every tracked
  file. Regimen data (names, molecules, schedule, chip order) moved to the
  gitignored `regimen.local.json`; `add_regimen.py` and `tidy_extras.py` read
  it and refuse to run without it; `app.py`'s `PRN_SEED` and `DOCTOR_SEED`
  read it via `_local_seed()` and fall back to empty, so a fresh install
  starts with no medicines and no doctors rather than the owner's. Applied by
  `patch_redact_seed.py`. **Past commits still contain the names — history was
  deliberately not rewritten.** This stops future disclosure only.
- **2026-09-10 hardening (1)** — Flask `SECRET_KEY` rotated (logged out all
  devices, by design), infrastructure detail moved out of this file into the
  gitignored `INFRA_GutLog.local.md`, and `tools/NO_SECRETS.py` added: blocks
  databases, env files and credential literals, warns on clinical detail.
- **2026-09-10 v3.3.3** — row actions. Tapping an already-logged dose row opens
  an Undo / Change dose / Skip strip instead of toggling, so an accidental
  second tap cannot delete a medication record.
- **2026-09-10 v3.3.2** — dose variants. A scheduled medicine whose dose varies
  across three strengths offers a multi-select picker at log time.
- **2026-09-10 v3.3.1** — small-screen layout fix.
- **2026-09-10 v3.3.0** — Phase A quick-log surface: the Now tab, the
  `med_schedule` table with effective dating and epochs, PWA install support
  (`pwa.py`), `episodes.bristol` column. Migration `migrate_gutlog_v330.py`,
  suite `test_migration_v330.py`.
